            <p>
              Characters in Brawl Stars are known as brawlers. Each brawler has
              unique abilities as well as advantages and weaknesses when
              compared to other brawlers. Many balance changes are implemented
              as a ways to balance the game and make sure no brawler is too good
              or too bad. There are currently 72 brawlers in the game and the
              META (most effective tactics available) in this case are the
              brawlers which are at the top meaning they are usually better than
              most other brawlers. This always changes as balance changes are
              quite frequent so it is possible for a very good brawler to
              suddenly fall out of the meta or for a bad brawler to suddenly
              become part of the META.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each brawler has a basic attack which players can always use as
              long as they have ammo which is shown on the top. They also have a
              special ability which is known as a "Super" which can be used once
              this bar is charged. It can become game changing if used
              correctly. Each brawler also has 2 gadgets which help the brawler
              such as extra speed, health or even better sight. Finally, there
              are some brawlers which have a super charge system which is a new
              game changing element in the game. This allows certain brawlers to
              increase in damage, speed and their super will now have an extra
              effect whether it may be extra range, damage or size.
