              <h3>The beginning</h3>
              <p>
                Supercell, a mobile game development company first set out to
                develop a game based on league of legends and overwatch with the
                main ideas of a simple battle royale type game.
              </p>

              <h3>The creation</h3>
              <p>
                On June the 14th, 2017, Supercell had officially announced the
                game during a livestream which would eventually receive an iOS
                soft launch in Canada. This would last 522 days as there were
                many doubts whether there would be a general release.

              <h3>Massive changes</h3>
              <p>
                During this time, many changes were implemented for smoother and
                better gameplay. This included the game being played in portrait
                mode now being landscape as well as analog controls. Another
                change included the UI, which changed the game from 2D to 3D.

              <h3>Beta</h3>
              <p>
                On January 19, 2018 the game was officially in Beta as it now
                became available in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Ireland,
                Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Malaysia for iOS. On June 26 in
                the same year, android had now received early access to the
                game.

              <h3>Global Release</h3>
              <p>
                On December 12, 2018, Brawl Stars finally went global which was
                officially announced during a livestream on November 14th. This
                marked a huge achievement as it made 63 million dollars (USD)
                within the first month and on June 9th, 2020, Brawl Stars was
                released in China.

              <h3>The aftermath</h3>
              <p>
                Currently, the game has received many updates and changes and
                will continue to do so. The game has dipped in players and fame
                since global release however it still remains in the top 40
                action games in the apple store.
